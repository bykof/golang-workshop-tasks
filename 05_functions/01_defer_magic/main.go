/*
    Task:
        Read a string from stdin.
        Implement a function called PrintReverse(s string),
        which prints a string in the reverse order just by using defer!


        Hint:
            Defer is STACKABLE therefore try to print every letter within a defer function

   Output:
       > Hello
       olleH
       > World
       dlroW
